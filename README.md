ADMSL
=====

Algorithmically Differentiated Library of a part of the standard library Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Basic 


Description
=========== 

An illustrative example for algorithmic differentiation of some of the components of the modelica standard 
library Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Basic 


Aims and goals
==============

It represents a testing platform for algoirhtmic differerntiation of Modelica libraries w.r.t.
  * algorithmic methodologies 
  * identifying current limitations towards AD of Modelica models  
  * suggesting / recommending further potential language improvements towards AD of Modelica models
